# Twitter-Analytics

In this project, I created a geographical representation using Twitter data spanning the United States. The map illustrates the varying sentiments of people from different states towards the dataset. The visual is produced through the following steps:

## Gathering public Twitter posts (Tweets) that are associated with specific geographic locations and refining the results to include only those that feature the "cali" keyword.

## Assigning a sentiment (either positive or negative) to each Tweet based on its textual content.

## Grouping the Tweets by state, using the state with the nearest geographical center as the reference point.

## Color-coding each state based on the combined sentiment of its Tweets. States with positive sentiment are shaded in yellow, while those with negative sentiment are shaded in blue.
